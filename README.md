## About the Project

This project is a command-line application built using Node.js and Inquirer for user input. It allows freelance developers and small businesses to create custom logos without the need for graphic design expertise. Users can specify text content (up to three characters), choose a shape (Circle, Square, Triangle), and set colors for the shape and text.

The application generates an SVG file named `logo.svg`, which users can open in a web browser to view and use as needed.
